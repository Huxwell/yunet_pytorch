    """Stores assignments between predicted and truth boxes.
    Attributes:
        num_gts (int): the number of truth boxes considered when computing this
            assignment
        gt_inds (LongTensor): for each predicted box indicates the 1-based
            index of the assigned truth box. 0 means unassigned and -1 means
            ignore.
        max_overlaps (FloatTensor): the iou between the predicted box and its
            assigned truth box.
        labels (None | LongTensor): If specified, for each predicted box
            indicates the category label of the assigned truth box.
    Example:
        >>> # An assign result between 4 predicted boxes and 9 true boxes
        >>> # where only two boxes were assigned.
        >>> num_gts = 9
